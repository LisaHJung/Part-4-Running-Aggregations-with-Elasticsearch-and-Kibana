# Beginner's Crash Course to Elastic Stack Series
## Part 4: Running Aggregations with Elasticsearch andKibana
Welcome to the Beginner's Crash Course to Elastic Stack!

This repo contains all resources shared during Part 4: Running Aggregations with Elasticsearch and Kibana.

We search for things on a daily basis. Sometimes, we seek to retrieve documents based on the specific criteria(i.e. retrieving songs by our favorite artist). Other times, we seek to gain insight by summarizing our data(i.e. Report on monthly revenue generated by an artist’s concert tour). 

Throughout the Beginner’s Crash Course, we primarily focused on retrieving documents by sending queries to Elasticsearch. This workshop will focus on aggregations, which summarizes your data as metrics, statistics, or other analytics!

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to run:
- metric aggregations
- buckets aggregations
- combined aggregations

## Preparing the data set
Run these queries in order specified below. 

STEP 1: Use delete_by_query to delete UnitPrice values less than 1. 
```
POST Enter_name_of_Index/_delete_by_query
{
  "query": {
    "range" : {
        "UnitPrice" : {
           "lte" : 1
        }
    }
  }
}
```

STEP 2:Use delete_by_query to delete UnitPrice values greater than 500. 
```
POST Enter_name_of_Index/_delete_by_query
{
  "query": {
    "range" : {
        "UnitPrice" : {
           "gte" : 500
        }
    }
  }
}
```
STEP 3: Create a new index called ecommerce_data and assign data types to the fields you expect this index to store. 
```
PUT ecommerce_data
{
  "mappings": {
    "_meta": {
      "created_by": "ml-file-data-visualizer"
    },
    "properties": {
      "Country": {
        "type": "keyword"
      },
      "CustomerID": {
        "type": "long"
      },
      "Description": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "InvoiceDate": {
        "type": "date",
        "format": "M/d/yyyy H:m"
      },
      "InvoiceNo": {
        "type": "keyword"
      },
      "Quantity": {
        "type": "long"
      },
      "StockCode": {
        "type": "keyword"
      },
      "UnitPrice": {
        "type": "double"
      }
    }
  }
}
```   
STEP 4: Copy documents from the original index you added E-commerce data to(source) to the ecommerce_data index you just created(destination).
```
POST _reindex
{
  "source": {
    "index": "name of your original index"
  },
  "dest": {
    "index": "ecommerce_data"
  }
}
```
## Review from Workshop Part 3
There are two main ways to search in Elasticsearch:
1) `Queries`retrieve documents that match the specified criteria. 
2) `Aggregations` present the summary of your data as metrics, statistics, and other analytics.

### Get information about documents in an index
The following query will retrieve all documents that exist in the specified index. This query is a great way to explore the structure and content of your document. 

Syntax: 
```
GET Enter_name_of_the_index_here/_search
```
Example: 
```
GET e_commerce/_search
```
Expected response from Elasticsearch:

Elasticsearch displays a number of hits and a sample of 10 search results by default.  The field "_ source"(line 22) lists all fields or content of the document.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60980933/112375185-9c52d280-8ca8-11eb-9952-16f24171dfbd.png)

## Aggregations Requests
Syntax:
```
GET Enter_name_of_the_index_here/_search
{
  "aggs" or "aggregations": {
    "Name your aggregation here": {
      "Specify aggregation type here": {
        "field": "Name the field you want to aggregate here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Metric Aggregations 
`Metric` aggregations compute a value based on a set of documents. It can be used to calculate values of `sum`,`min`, `max`, `avg`,  `percentiles` and unique count(`cardinality`). 

#### Compute the `sum` of all unit prices in the data set

Syntax:
```
GET Enter_name_of_the_index_here/_search
{
  "aggs" or "aggregations": {
    "Name your aggregation here": {
      "sum": {
        "field": "Name the field you want to aggregate here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Example:
```
GET e_commerce/_search
{
  "aggs": {
    "sum_unit_price": {
      "sum": {
        "field":"UnitPrice"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Expected response from Elasticsearch:

By default, Elasticsearch will return top 10 most relevant documents. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60980933/112508582-4d16ab80-8d55-11eb-93c1-09e956a14aaf.png)

When you minimize hits(red box- line 10), you will see the aggregations report we named sum_unit_price(image below). This report displays the sum of all unit prices listed in our data set. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60980933/112512282-da0f3400-8d58-11eb-892d-0f577c9247fd.png)

If the purpose of running an aggregation is solely to get the values of aggregations, you can add the size parameter and set it to 0 as shown below. This parameter will prevent Elasticsearch from fetching the top 10 documents and speed up the query. 

Example:
```
GET e_commerce/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "sum_unit_price": {
      "sum": {
        "field":"UnitPrice"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Expected response from Elasticsearch:

Now you do not need to minimize hits to get to the aggregations report! We will be adding the size parameter to all aggregations request from this point on.

#### multiply mutiple fields and get a sum
```
GET e_commerce_2/_search
{
    "aggs": {
        "total_price": {
            "sum": {
                "script": {
                    "lang": "painless",
                    "inline": "doc['UnitPrice'].value * doc['Quantity'].value"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
#### Compute the lowest(`min`) unit price of an item 

Syntax:
```
GET Enter_name_of_the_index_here/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs" or "aggregations": {
    "Name your aggregation here": {
      "min": {
        "field": "Name the field you want to aggregate here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Example: 
```
GET e_commerce/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "lowest_unit_price": {
      "min": {
        "field":"UnitPrice"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Expected response from Elasticsearch:

The lowest unit price of an item is 1.01. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60980933/112509885-869be680-8d56-11eb-9c2e-5935ff7437e8.png)

#### Compute the highest(`max`) unit price of an item 
Syntax:
```
GET Enter_name_of_the_index_here/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs" or "aggregations": {
    "Name your aggregation here": {
      "max": {
        "field": "Name the field you want to aggregate here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Example: 
```
GET e_commerce/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "highest_unit_price": {
      "max": {
        "field":"UnitPrice"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Expected response from Elasticsearch:
The highest unit price of an item is 498.79. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60980933/112511189-cca57a00-8d57-11eb-9ab3-809b2a410636.png)

#### Compute the `average` unit price of items in the inventory 
Syntax:
```
GET Enter_name_of_the_index_here/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs" or "aggregations": {
    "Name your aggregation here": {
      "avg": {
        "field": "Name the field you want to aggregate here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Example: 
```
GET e_commerce/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "average_unit_price": {
      "avg": {
        "field":"UnitPrice"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Expected response from Elasticsearch: 

Average unit price in our invetory is around 4.39.

#### `Stats` Aggregation: Analyze the data to compute all the main metrics(count, min, max, avg, sum) in one request. 
Syntax:
```
GET Enter_name_of_the_index_here/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs" or "aggregations": {
    "Name your aggregation here": {
      "stats": {
        "field": "Name the field you want to aggregate here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Example:
```
GET e_commerce/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "all_stats_unit_price": {
      "stats": {
        "field": "UnitPrice"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Expected Response from Elasticsearch:

Stats aggregation will yield the values of `count`(the number of unit prices aggregation was performed on), `min`, `max`, `avg`, and `sum`(sum of all unit prices in the data set). 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60980933/112512994-84875700-8d59-11eb-938a-fb7c61aee2b2.png)

#### The Percentiles Aggregations
The percentiles aggregations computes the percentile values of data set. 
What if you wanted to know what percentage of your data set falls under certain values?
i.e. What unit price fall under 25%, 50%, 75% percentile? 

Syntax:
```
GET Enter_name_of_the_index_here/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
     "Name your aggregation here": {
      "percentiles": {
        "field":"Name the field you want to aggregate here",
        "percents": [
          "List the percentile",
          "List the percentile",
          "List the percentile"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Example: 
```
GET e_commerce/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "unit_price_percentiles": {
      "percentiles": {
        "field":"UnitPrice",
        "percents": [
          25,
          50,
          75
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Expected response from Elasticsearch:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60980933/112532003-e81b7f80-8d6d-11eb-9f1f-e34145bced86.png)

25% of unit price values are less than 1.65.
50% of unit price values are less than 2.89.
75% of unit price values are less than 4.95.

#### The Cardinality Aggregations
The cardinality aggregation computes the count of unique values for a given field. 
Please note that the count is approximated.

Example: 
```
GET e_commerce/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "number_of_customers": {
      "cardinality": {
        "field":"CustomerID"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Expected response from Elasticsearch: 

Approximately, there are 4325 unique number of customers in our data set. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60980933/112532216-2add5780-8d6e-11eb-9649-edd1c38dbd44.png)

#### Aggregations Scope: Analyze the data to compute the average unit price of items sold in Germany

In the previous example, the aggregation was run on all the documents in the e_commerce index. What happens if you want to run an aggregation on a subset of the documents? 

For example, our e-commerce index contains e-commerce data from multiple European countries. What if you want to focus on the average of unit price of items sold in Germany? 

To limit the scope of the query, a query clause can be added to an aggregation. The query defines the subset of documents that aggregations should be ran. 

The combined query and aggregations look like the following: 

Syntax:
```
GET Enter_name_of_the_index_here/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "query": {
    "Enter match or match_phrase here": { "Enter the name of the field": "Enter the value you are looking for" }
  },
  "aggregations": {
    "Name your aggregation here": {
      "Specify aggregation type here": {
        "field": "Name the field you want to aggregate here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Example: 
```
GET e_commerce/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "Country": "Germany"
    }
  },
  "aggs": {
    "germany_average_unit_price": {
      "avg": {
        "field":"UnitPrice"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Expected response from Elasticsearch:

The average of unit price of items sold in Germany is 4.58.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60980933/112534501-c1ab1380-8d70-11eb-9ce7-507953cc26d0.png)

The combination of query and aggregation allowed us to perform aggregations on A SUBSET of documents. What if we wanted to perform aggreations on SEVERAL SUBSETS of documents? 

This is where Bucket Aggregations come into play! 

###  Bucket Aggregations
Buckets are collection of documents that share a common criteria. There are many ways to group documents into buckets.

1. Date Histogram Aggregation
2. Histogram Aggregations
3. Range Aggregation
4. Terms aggregations

#### 1.The Date Histogram Aggregation
When you want an overview of the data distributed over time, grouping documents into buckets based on time interval comes in handy. 

There are two ways to define the time interval.

1. Fixed_interval:The inverval is always constant
Example: orders by 7 days

```
GET e_commerce/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "orders_by_week": {
      "date_histogram": {
        "field":"InvoiceDate",
        "fixed_interval": "7d"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Expected response from Elasticsearch:

2. Calendar_interval: The interval may vary
Ex. Sales data for each month(Due to daylight savings observed in the US, the length of specific days can vary. Some months have different number of days)

Example: 
```
GET e_commerce/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "orders_by_month": {
      "date_histogram": {
        "field":"InvoiceDate",
        "calendar_interval": "1M"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Expected response from Elasticsearch:

#### Histogram Aggregations
Histogram aggregations can be applied to any numerical field. 
Distribution of order amounts. Specify an interval, ake bueckts for each interval between minimum and maximum value for the field. 

Syntax: 
```
POST e_commerce/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs" or "aggregations": {
    "Name your aggregation here": {
      "histogram": {
        "field":"Name the field you want to aggregate here",
        "interval": State the interval here
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Example: 
```
POST e_commerce/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "prices": {
      "histogram": {
        "field": "UnitPrice",
        "interval": 5
      }
    }
  }
}

```

### The Range Aggregation 
In the previous example, your intervals had the same preset size. What if you want to create custom intervals or intervals of varying sizes? You can use the range bucket aggregation which allows you to define your own intervals.

Syntax:
```
GET Enter_name_of_the_index_here/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs" or "aggregations": {
     "Name your aggregation here": {
      "range": {
        "field":"Name the field you want to aggregate here",
        "ranges": [
          { "to": x },
          { "from": x, "to": y },
          { "from": z }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
````
Example: 

```
GET e_commerce/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "price_ranges": {
      "range": {
        "field": "UnitPrice",
        "ranges": [
          { "to": 50 },
          { "from": 50, "to": 100 },
          { "from": 100 }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}

```
Expected response from Elasticsearch:

#### The Terms Aggregation
The terms aggregation will return a specified number of buckets of the most commonly seen values in a field

Syntax:
```
GET Enter_name_of_the_index_here/_search
{
  "aggregations": {
    "Name your aggregation here": {
      "terms": {
        "field": "Name the field you want to aggregate here",
        "size": State how many buckets you want returned here
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Example:
```
GET e_commerce/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "top_5_customers": {
      "terms": { 
        "field": "CustomerID", 
        "size": 5
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Combining Aggregations
Some questions need a combination of aggregation to be answered. What is the sum of revenue per day? 
This requires both metric and buckets aggregation. 

#### Daily revenue
```
GET e_commerce_2/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "orders_by_day": {
      "date_histogram": {
        "field":"InvoiceDate",
        "calendar_interval": "day"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "daily_revenue": {
          "sum": {
            "script": {
              "source": 
                "doc['UnitPrice'].value * doc['Quantity'].value"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Split the documents into daily buckets. multiply unitprice and quantity of each document than get the sum of it. To do this, create a new aggregation inside the first aggregation. 
This new aggregation compute the sum of the field unitprice and quantity on every bueckt. 

Each bucket - orders by day
alson contains the sub aggregation called daily revenue

```
GET e_commerce_2/_search
{
  "size": 0,
  "aggs": {
    "orders_by_day": {
      "date_histogram": {
        "field":"InvoiceDate",
        "calendar_interval": "day"
      },
      "aggs": {
        "daily_revenue": {
          "sum": {
            "script": {
              "source": 
                "doc['UnitPrice'].value * doc['Quantity'].value"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
